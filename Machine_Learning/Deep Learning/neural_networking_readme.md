# Neural Networks in Machine Learning

Neural networks are powerful models inspired by the human brain's structure and functionality. They are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data, making them versatile tools in various machine learning tasks. This README provides an overview of different types of neural networks, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

Feedforward neural networks, also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), are the simplest form of artificial neural networks. They consist of multiple layers of neurons, where information flows in one direction, from input to output.

### Mathematical Concept: Forward Propagation

In forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network, and computations are performed layer by layer to produce the output. Each neuron applies a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity.

\[ z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} \cdot a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)} \]
\[ a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)}) \]

Where:
- \( z^{(l)} \) is the weighted sum of inputs at layer \( l \).
- \( a^{(l)} \) is the activation of layer \( l \).
- \( W^{(l)} \) and \( b^{(l)} \) are the weights and biases of layer \( l \).
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They leverage convolutional layers to detect local patterns and hierarchical representations.

### Mathematical Concept: Convolution Operation

In CNNs, the convolution operation involves sliding a filter (kernel) over the input image to extract local features. The filter weights are learned during training through backpropagation.

\[ (f \ast g)(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{k} f(i, j) \cdot g(x - i, y - j) \]

Where:
- \( f \) is the input image.
- \( g \) is the filter.
- \( k \) is the filter size.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal state (memory) to capture temporal dependencies. They are widely used in natural language processing, time series analysis, and sequence generation tasks.

### Mathematical Concept: Recurrent Computation

In RNNs, the output of each time step is computed based on the current input and the previous hidden state, allowing the network to capture temporal dependencies.

\[ h^{(t)} = \text{tanh}(W_{hx}x^{(t)} + W_{hh}h^{(t-1)} + b_h) \]
\[ y^{(t)} = \text{softmax}(W_{yh}h^{(t)} + b_y) \]

Where:
- \( h^{(t)} \) is the hidden state at time step \( t \).
- \( x^{(t)} \) is the input at time step \( t \).
- \( W_{hx} \) and \( W_{hh} \) are the weights.
- \( b_h \) is the bias.
- \( \text{tanh} \) is the hyperbolic tangent activation function.
- \( y^{(t)} \) is the output at time step \( t \).
- \( W_{yh} \) is the weight matrix connecting the hidden state to the output.
- \( b_y \) is the bias for the output layer.
- \( \text{softmax} \) is the softmax activation function.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies. They include gated units that regulate the flow of information, enabling better preservation of information over time.

### Mathematical Concept: LSTM Cell

LSTM networks contain specialized cells that maintain an internal cell state and regulate the flow of information through gates: input gate, forget gate, and output gate.

\[ f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \]
\[ i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \]
\[ o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \]
\[ \tilde{C}_t = \text{tanh}(W_c \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) \]
\[ C_t = f_t \ast C_{t-1} + i_t \ast \tilde{C}_t \]
\[ h_t = o_t \ast \text{tanh}(C_t) \]

Where:
- \( f_t \) is the forget gate.
- \( i_t \) is the input gate.
- \( o_t \) is the output gate.
- \( \tilde{C}_t \) is the candidate cell state.
- \( C_t \) is the cell state.
- \( h_t \) is the hidden state.
- \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid activation function.
- \( \ast \) denotes element-wise multiplication.
- \( W_f, W_i, W_o, W_c \) are weight matrices.
- \( b_f, b_i, b_o, b_c \) are bias vectors.
