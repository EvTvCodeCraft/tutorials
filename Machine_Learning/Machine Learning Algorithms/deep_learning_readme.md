# Deep Learning Architectures

Deep learning architectures are powerful models capable of learning hierarchical representations from data, enabling them to solve complex tasks. This README provides comprehensive explanations, methodologies, and mathematical formulations for popular deep learning architectures.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are the foundation of deep learning, inspired by the biological neurons in the human brain.

### Methodology:
1. **Neural Network Layers**:
   - Composed of input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
   - Each layer consists of neurons (nodes) interconnected by weighted connections.

2. **Feedforward Propagation**:
   - Compute activations of neurons in hidden layers and output layer through a series of matrix multiplications and activation functions.
     \[ a^{(l)} = \sigma(z^{(l)}) \]
     \[ z^{(l)} = W^{(l)} a^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)} \]

3. **Backpropagation**:
   - Update the weights of connections iteratively using gradient descent to minimize the loss function.
     \[ \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(l)}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial J^{(i)}}{\partial W^{(l)}} \]
     \[ W^{(l)} := W^{(l)} - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(l)}} \]

### Applications:
- Classification, regression, etc.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are specialized architectures for processing structured grid data, such as images.

### Methodology:
1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Apply convolutional filters (kernels) to extract spatial features from input images.
   - Use activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity.
     \[ z_{ij}^{(l)} = \sum_{r=0}^{f-1} \sum_{c=0}^{f-1} x_{(i+r)(j+c)}^{(l-1)} \ast W_{rc}^{(l)} + b^{(l)} \]
     \[ a_{ij}^{(l)} = \sigma(z_{ij}^{(l)}) \]

2. **Pooling Layers**:
   - Downsample feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
   - Common pooling operations include max pooling and average pooling.

3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Flatten the feature maps and connect them to a fully connected layer for classification or regression.

### Applications:
- Image classification, object detection, etc.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are designed to process sequential data with temporal dependencies.

### Methodology:
1. **Recurrent Connections**:
   - Introduce recurrent connections that allow information to persist over time steps.
   - Each neuron maintains a hidden state that captures temporal context.
     \[ h_t = \sigma(W_{hx} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b_h) \]

2. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**:
   - RNNs suffer from vanishing gradient problem, limiting their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
   - LSTM introduces memory cells and gating mechanisms to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.
     \[ f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \]
     \[ i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \]
     \[ o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \]
     \[ \tilde{c}_t = \text{tanh}(W_c \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) \]
     \[ c_t = f_t \cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{c}_t \]
     \[ h_t = o_t \cdot \text{tanh}(c_t) \]

### Applications:
- Natural language processing, time series prediction, etc.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a variant of RNN designed to model long-term dependencies more effectively.

### Methodology:
1. **LSTM Cell**:
   - Consists of a memory cell and three gates (input gate, forget gate, output gate) that regulate the flow of information.

2. **Gate Operations**:
   - Gates use sigmoid activation functions to control the flow of information and decide what to remember, forget, and output.

3. **Memory Cell State**:
   - The memory cell state allows LSTM to retain information over long sequences without suffering from vanishing gradient.

### Applications:
- Speech recognition, sentiment analysis, etc.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of models that learn to generate data by training a generator network to produce realistic samples and a discriminator network to distinguish between real and fake samples.

### Methodology:
1. **Generator Network**:
   - Generates fake samples from random noise or latent vectors.
   - Trained to produce samples that are indistinguishable from real samples.

2. **Discriminator Network**:
   - Distinguishes between real and fake samples.
   - Trained to correctly classify real and fake samples.

3. **Adversarial Training**:
   - The generator and discriminator are trained adversarially, where the generator aims to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake samples.

### Applications:
- Image generation, style transfer, etc.
