# Hyperparameter Tuning Methods

Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing the performance of machine learning models. This README provides detailed explanations and methodologies for three popular hyperparameter tuning methods: Grid Search, Randomized Search, and Bayesian optimization.

## Grid Search

Grid Search is a systematic method that searches for the optimal combination of hyperparameters by evaluating all possible combinations within a predefined grid.

### Methodology:
1. Define a grid of hyperparameters and their respective values.
2. Perform an exhaustive search over the grid.
3. Evaluate each combination using cross-validation.
4. Select the combination with the highest performance metric.

### Benefits:
- Exhaustive search over all combinations ensures finding the best hyperparameters within the defined grid.

### Limitations:
- Computationally expensive, especially for large hyperparameter spaces.

## Randomized Search

Randomized Search is a more efficient alternative to Grid Search, which randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from specified distributions.

### Methodology:
1. Define probability distributions for each hyperparameter.
2. Sample combinations randomly from the distributions.
3. Evaluate each combination using cross-validation.
4. Select the combination with the highest performance metric.

### Benefits:
- More computationally efficient than Grid Search, especially for large hyperparameter spaces.
- Allows exploration of a broader range of hyperparameter values.

### Limitations:
- May miss the optimal solution due to random sampling.

## Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization is an advanced technique that models the objective function and selects the next hyperparameter combination based on previous evaluations.

### Methodology:
1. Build a probabilistic model of the objective function.
2. Select the next hyperparameter combination using an acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement).
3. Evaluate the objective function for the selected combination.
4. Update the probabilistic model with the new data.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a predefined budget is exhausted.

### Benefits:
- Efficiently explores the hyperparameter space by intelligently selecting promising combinations.
- Requires fewer evaluations compared to random or exhaustive search methods.

### Limitations:
- Requires tuning of hyperparameters for the probabilistic model.
- May struggle with highly nonlinear or discontinuous objective functions.

## Conclusion

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in optimizing machine learning models for better performance. Grid Search, Randomized Search, and Bayesian optimization are popular methods for efficiently exploring the hyperparameter space and finding the optimal combination. By understanding these methods and their methodologies, practitioners can effectively tune their models and achieve improved results in real-world applications.
