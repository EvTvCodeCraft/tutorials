# Overfitting and Underfitting in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in machine learning that can affect the performance and generalization ability of machine learning models. This README provides an overview of these concepts, including the bias-variance tradeoff and regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting and underfitting.

## Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff

The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that balances the complexity of a model with its ability to generalize to unseen data.

### Mathematical Concept: Bias and Variance

- **Bias**: Bias measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias models may underfit the training data.
  
- **Variance**: Variance measures the sensitivity of a model's predictions to fluctuations in the training data. High variance models may overfit the training data.

### Bias-Variance Decomposition

The expected mean squared error (MSE) of a model can be decomposed into three components: bias, variance, and irreducible error.

\[ \text{Expected MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error} \]

## Regularization Techniques

Regularization techniques are methods used to reduce overfitting by penalizing the complexity of a model.

### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the model's coefficients.

\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\theta_i| \]

Where:
- \(\lambda\) is the regularization parameter.
- \(\theta_i\) are the model coefficients.

### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's coefficients.

\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Original Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_i^2 \]

### Dropout Regularization

Dropout regularization randomly drops a fraction of neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any individual feature.

### Mathematical Concept: Dropout

During training, each neuron is retained with a probability \(p\) and dropped with a probability \(1-p\). The output of each neuron is scaled by a factor of \(\frac{1}{p}\) during training to account for the dropped neurons.

## Conclusion

Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in machine learning that can affect the performance and generalization ability of models. By understanding the bias-variance tradeoff and employing regularization techniques such as L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout, practitioners can mitigate overfitting and underfitting and build models that generalize well to unseen data.
