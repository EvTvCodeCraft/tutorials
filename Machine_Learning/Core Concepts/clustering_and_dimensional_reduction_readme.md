# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Clustering and dimensionality reduction are essential techniques in unsupervised machine learning, aiding in data exploration, pattern discovery, and simplifying complex datasets. This README delves into K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), elucidating their mathematical underpinnings and applications.

## Clustering

Clustering aims to partition data points into cohesive groups based on their similarities, enabling pattern recognition and data segmentation without predefined class labels.

### K-means Clustering

**K-means** is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that iteratively assigns data points to \(k\) clusters, minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia). The algorithm comprises the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Randomly select \(k\) data points as initial cluster centroids.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming \(k\) clusters.
3. **Update Centroids**: Recalculate the centroids as the mean of data points in each cluster.
4. **Convergence**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (minimal change in centroid positions).

#### Mathematical Concept: K-means Algorithm

Given \(N\) data points \(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N\), and cluster centroids \(\mathbf{c}_1, \mathbf{c}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{c}_k\), the objective function to minimize is the sum of squared Euclidean distances from each data point to its assigned centroid:

\[ J = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \min_{j} \|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{c}_j\|^2 \]

Where \(\|\cdot\|\) denotes Euclidean distance.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information, alleviating the curse of dimensionality and enhancing model interpretability and computational efficiency.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a popular linear dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while maximizing variance.

#### Mathematical Concept: PCA Algorithm

Given a dataset with \(N\) data points and \(D\) features, PCA involves the following steps:

1. **Standardization**: Standardize the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature.
2. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) of the standardized data.
3. **Eigendecomposition**: Calculate the eigenvectors \(\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_D\) and corresponding eigenvalues \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_D\) of \(\Sigma\).
4. **Sort Eigenpairs**: Sort eigenpairs by decreasing eigenvalues to select the top \(k\) eigenvectors.
5. **Projection**: Project the standardized data onto the subspace spanned by the selected eigenvectors to obtain the transformed dataset.

## Conclusion

Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques play pivotal roles in unsupervised machine learning, facilitating data exploration, pattern discovery, and model simplification. By comprehending algorithms like K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and their mathematical intricacies, practitioners can effectively preprocess and analyze datasets for various machine learning tasks.
