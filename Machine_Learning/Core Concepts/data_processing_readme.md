# Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for training machine learning models. This README provides an overview of common data preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

## Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values

Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset, while handling missing values involves dealing with observations that have missing or incomplete data.

### Mathematical Concept: Mean Imputation

Mean imputation is a simple method for handling missing values by replacing them with the mean of the observed values for that feature.

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \]

Where:
- \(x_i\) is the observed value for the feature.
- \(n\) is the number of observations.

## Feature Scaling and Normalization

Feature scaling and normalization are techniques used to standardize the range of features in the dataset, ensuring that they have a similar scale.

### Mathematical Concept: Min-Max Scaling

Min-Max scaling rescales the feature values to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1.

\[ x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x - \text{min}(x)}{\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)} \]

Where:
- \(x\) is the original feature value.
- \(\text{min}(x)\) is the minimum value of the feature.
- \(\text{max}(x)\) is the maximum value of the feature.

## One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding

One-hot encoding and label encoding are techniques used to encode categorical variables into numerical format.

### Mathematical Concept: One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into binary vectors, where each category is represented by a binary value (0 or 1).

\[ \text{Category}_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if the observation belongs to category } i \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

### Mathematical Concept: Label Encoding

Label encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in the dataset.

\[ \text{Category}_i = i \]

## Conclusion

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, ensuring that the dataset is clean, standardized, and suitable for training machine learning models. By understanding common data preprocessing techniques and the mathematical concepts behind them, practitioners can effectively prepare their data for machine learning tasks.
