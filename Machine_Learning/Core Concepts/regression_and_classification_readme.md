# Regression and Classification in Machine Learning

## Introduction

Regression and classification are two fundamental tasks in supervised machine learning. Regression models predict continuous numerical values, while classification models predict discrete categorical labels. This README provides an overview of these concepts, including linear regression and logistic regression as examples of regression and classification algorithms, respectively.

## Basics of Regression and Classification

### Regression

Regression involves predicting a continuous numerical value based on input features. It is commonly used for tasks such as predicting house prices, stock prices, or sales revenue.

### Classification

Classification involves predicting the category or class label of a data point based on its features. It is commonly used for tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or image classification.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple and commonly used regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (\(y\)) and one or more independent variables (\(x\)) as a linear equation.

### Mathematical Concept: Simple Linear Regression

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable (\(x\)). The relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is modeled by a straight line equation:

\[ y = mx + b \]

Where:
- \(m\) is the slope of the line.
- \(b\) is the y-intercept.

The parameters \(m\) and \(b\) are estimated from the training data using techniques like least squares regression.

### Mathematical Concept: Multiple Linear Regression

In multiple linear regression, there are multiple independent variables (\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)). The relationship between the independent variables and \(y\) is modeled by a linear equation:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n \]

Where:
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept.
- \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) are the coefficients.

The parameters \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n\) are estimated from the training data using techniques like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a commonly used classification technique that models the probability that a data point belongs to a particular class.

### Mathematical Concept: Logistic Function

In logistic regression, the logistic function (or sigmoid function) is used to model the relationship between the input features and the probability of belonging to the positive class.

\[ P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]

Where:
- \( P(y=1|x) \) is the probability of belonging to the positive class given input features \(x\).
- \( z \) is the linear combination of the input features and model coefficients.

The model coefficients are estimated from the training data using techniques like maximum likelihood estimation.

## Conclusion

Regression and classification are fundamental tasks in supervised machine learning, with linear regression and logistic regression being common algorithms for these tasks, respectively. By understanding the mathematical concepts underlying these algorithms, practitioners can effectively apply regression and classification techniques to solve a wide range of predictive modeling problems.
