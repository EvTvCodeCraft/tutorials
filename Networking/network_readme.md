  - **Understanding Computer Networking Basics:**
    - Familiarize yourself with fundamental networking concepts, including data transmission, protocols, and network layers.

  - **Introduction to the Internet:**
    - Gain knowledge of how the internet works, its architecture, and the role of ISPs (Internet Service Providers).

  - **Network Hardware:**
    - Learn about network devices such as routers, switches, hubs, and their functionalities in a network.

- **Networking Concepts:**
  - **Network Models:**
    - Understand OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP models, and how they organize network functionalities.

  - **IP Addressing and Subnetting:**
    - Learn about IP addresses, subnetting, CIDR notation, and how IP addressing works in a network.

  - **Routing and Switching:**
    - Understand routing algorithms, routing tables, switching techniques, and how data packets are forwarded in a network.

  - **Network Protocols:**
    - Learn about common network protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and FTP.

  - **Network Topologies:**
    - Understand different network topologies, including star, bus, ring, and mesh.

- **Network Administration:**
  - **Network Configuration and Setup:**
    - Learn how to configure and set up network devices, including routers, switches, and access points.

  - **Network Security:**
    - Understand network security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, VPNs, and best practices for securing a network.
