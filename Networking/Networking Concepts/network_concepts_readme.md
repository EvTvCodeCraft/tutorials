## Concepts Covered

This repository covers a variety of fundamental networking concepts, including:

- **Introduction to Networking:**
  - What is a computer network?
  - Types of computer networks (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN).

- **Network Topologies:**
  - Common network topologies (star, bus, ring, mesh).
  - Advantages and disadvantages of each topology.

- **Network Protocols:**
  - TCP/IP model and protocols.
  - OSI model and its layers.
  - Protocol stacks and encapsulation.

- **IP Addressing and Subnetting:**
  - IPv4 vs. IPv6.
  - IP address structure and classes.
  - Subnetting and CIDR notation.

- **Routing and Switching:**
  - Routing algorithms and protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
  - Switching techniques (store-and-forward, cut-through, fragment-free).

- **Network Security:**
  - Firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
  - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
  - Secure communication protocols (SSL, TLS).
