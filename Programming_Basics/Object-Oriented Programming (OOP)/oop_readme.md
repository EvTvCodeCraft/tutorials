## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. This repository aims to provide resources, tutorials, and guidance related to the basic principles of object-oriented programming.

## Getting Started

To start learning about OOP Basics, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Explore the Code and Tutorials:** Navigate through the repository to find code examples, tutorials, and resources related to different OOP concepts.

3. **Contribute:** If you'd like to contribute to this repository, refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Concepts Covered

This repository covers a variety of fundamental object-oriented programming concepts, including:

- **Classes and Objects:**
  - Definition and structure of classes
  - Creating objects and instances

- **Inheritance:**
  - Extending classes and creating subclasses
  - Overriding methods

- **Encapsulation:**
  - Access modifiers (public, private, protected)
  - Encapsulating data and methods within a class

- **Polymorphism:**
  - Method overloading and method overriding
  - Abstract classes and interfaces

- **Abstraction:**
  - Abstract classes and methods
  - Implementing abstraction in OOP
