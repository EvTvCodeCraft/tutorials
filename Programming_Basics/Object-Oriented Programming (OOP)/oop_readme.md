## 📝 Introduction

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects"—entities that encapsulate both data and behavior.

This repository provides:
- Practical **tutorials**
- **Code examples** in multiple languages
- Conceptual **explanations**
  
...all designed to help you understand and apply core OOP concepts.

## 🧱 Concepts Covered

We cover a wide range of beginner-friendly OOP concepts:

### 🔹 Classes and Objects
- Understanding class structure
- Creating and using objects

### 🔹 Inheritance
- Creating subclasses from base classes
- Overriding and extending functionality

### 🔹 Encapsulation
- Using access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`
- Protecting data and methods

### 🔹 Polymorphism
- Method overloading and overriding
- Abstract classes and interfaces

### 🔹 Abstraction
- Hiding complexity through abstract classes and methods
- Designing with interfaces
