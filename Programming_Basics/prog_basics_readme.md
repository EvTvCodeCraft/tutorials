## Programming Basics Roadmap

Programming Basics forms the foundation of computer programming. It includes understanding programming concepts, syntax, control flow, and data structures. The roadmap below guides you through essential concepts and stages in this domain.

- **Foundation:**
  - **Understanding Computers and Algorithms:**
    - Familiarize yourself with how computers work and basic algorithmic thinking to understand the fundamental principles of programming.

  - **Introduction to Programming Concepts:**
    - Gain knowledge of variables, data types, operators, and basic programming constructs like loops and conditionals.

  - **Problem-Solving Skills:**
    - Develop problem-solving skills by working on simple algorithms and logical reasoning.

- **Programming Concepts:**
  - **Variables and Data Types:**
    - Understand variables, constants, and various data types (integers, floats, strings) and their usage in programming.

  - **Control Flow:**
    - Learn about if-else statements, loops (for, while, do-while), switch statements, and how to control program flow.

  - **Functions:**
    - Understand how to define, call, and use functions. Learn about parameters, return values, and function scope.

  - **Error Handling:**
    - Learn about exception handling and how to manage errors in a program.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:**
  - **Arrays and Lists:**
    - Understand arrays and lists, how to create and manipulate them, and common operations.

  - **Stacks and Queues:**
    - Learn about stacks and queues, their properties, and how to use them in solving problems.

  - **Recursion:**
    - Understand recursion and its applications in solving problems.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - **Classes and Objects:**
    - Learn about classes, objects, constructors, and how to create instances of a class.

  - **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
    - Understand inheritance, polymorphism, and their usage in OOP.

  - **Encapsulation and Abstraction:**
    - Learn about encapsulation, abstraction, and how to design efficient class structures.

- **Version Control:**
