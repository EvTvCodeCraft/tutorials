## **Basics Covered** 📚

This repository covers a variety of **fundamental concepts** in both **data structures** and **algorithms**. Here’s a quick look at what’s included:

### **Data Structures** 📊

- **Arrays**: Ordered collections with a fixed size. Easy to access by index. 🧮
- **Linked Lists**: Collections of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. 🔗
- **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structures. Think of a stack of plates! 🍽️
- **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structures. Picture a line at a coffee shop ☕.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures like a family tree 🌳. Includes **binary trees** and **binary search trees**.
- **Graphs**: Collections of nodes and edges. Used in network structures like social media connections 🌐.
- **Hashing**: Includes **hash maps**, which map keys to values for quick look-ups. 🔑

### **Algorithms** 🔄

- **Searching Algorithms**: Learn to find elements in data using methods like **linear search** and **binary search** 🔍.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Understand how to order data with algorithms like **bubble sort**, **selection sort**, **merge sort**, and **quick sort** 📑.
- **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem 🔄.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A method used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems 💡.
