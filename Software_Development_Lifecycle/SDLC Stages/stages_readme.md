## üõ†Ô∏è Stages Covered

This repository covers a variety of stages in the **Software Development Lifecycle**, including:

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - **Understanding Stakeholder Needs**: The process of collecting requirements and ensuring alignment with business goals.
   - **Eliciting and Documenting Requirements**: Conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops to define clear requirements.
   - **Requirement Analysis**: Analyzing the requirements to ensure they are feasible and aligned with the system goals.

### 2. **System Design**
   - **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Creating the architecture of the system, detailing its components and their relationships.
   - **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Specifying the detailed design of components identified in HLD.
   - **Architecture Design**: Defining the technology stack, database, interfaces, and more.

### 3. **Implementation**
   - **Coding and Development**: Writing the code that implements the system based on the design documents.
   - **Unit Testing**: Ensuring that individual components work as expected.
   - **Code Integration**: Integrating different components to ensure they function together.

### 4. **Testing**
   - **Functional Testing**: Verifying that the software performs its intended functions.
   - **Non-functional Testing (Performance, Security)**: Assessing the software for non-functional requirements, such as speed and security.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validating the software in real-world scenarios, with end-users.

### 5. **Deployment**
   - **Preparing for Deployment**: Packaging the software and setting up the production environment.
   - **Deployment Strategies**: Choosing the appropriate strategy (e.g., blue/green, canary releases).
   - **Rollback Plan**: Developing a contingency plan in case the deployment encounters issues.

### 6. **Maintenance**
   - **Bug Fixing and Updates**: Resolving issues that arise post-deployment and updating the software with new features.
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously assessing the system‚Äôs performance to ensure it meets the desired standards.
   - **Customer Support**: Providing ongoing support to users and responding to their feedback.
