## 🛠️ Key Activities

### 🎯 Identifying Stakeholders

- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify all individuals, groups, and organizations with an interest in the software project, including users, clients, and team members.

### 📊 Gathering Requirements

- **Interviews & Surveys**: Conduct structured interviews and distribute surveys to gather insights and expectations from stakeholders.
- **Focus Groups**: Organize focus group sessions to discuss needs and requirements with stakeholders.
- **Observation**: Observe end-users in their environment to identify unarticulated needs or processes that the software can improve.

### 📄 Documenting and Analyzing Requirements

- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of the gathered requirements, including user stories, use cases, or functional specifications.
- **Requirements Analysis**: Analyze the requirements for feasibility, clarity, and potential conflicts with other requirements.

### ✅ Validation and Verification

- **Stakeholder Review**: Present the documented requirements to stakeholders for validation, ensuring all needs are accurately captured and understood.
- **Prioritization**: Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize requirements based on business value, necessity, and implementation complexity.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Clear Communication**: Establish open and effective channels of communication with stakeholders to facilitate efficient information gathering.
- **Active Listening**: Ensure that the team actively listens to stakeholder inputs, understanding their needs and concerns.
- **Iterative Review**: Encourage an iterative review process where requirements can be refined and updated as more information becomes available.
- **Use of Visual Aids**: Utilize visual aids like flowcharts, wireframes, or prototypes to help stakeholders better understand and validate requirements.
