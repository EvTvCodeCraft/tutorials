# SDLC Models Detailed Guide

## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth overview of the main Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models used in the software industry. Understanding these models helps teams align their development processes with project requirements, team dynamics, and organizational goals, ensuring efficient delivery of high-quality software.

## 🏞️ Waterfall Model

### 📖 Description

The **Waterfall model** is a traditional, linear, and sequential approach to software development. Each phase in the process must be completed before the next begins, with little to no overlap between stages. It is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear understanding of the scope from the outset.

This model emphasizes a structured progression through clearly defined stages, which helps ensure thorough documentation and disciplined project execution.

---

### 🧱 Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. ### **Requirement Analysis** 📝
   - Gather all system requirements from stakeholders.
   - Document them thoroughly in a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**.
   - No development begins until the requirements are fully understood and signed off.

2. ### **System Design** 🧩
   - Translate requirements into a system architecture and design blueprint.
   - Define hardware and system requirements.
   - Create detailed software design documents including data models, interface designs, and algorithms.

3. ### **Implementation** 💻
   - Actual coding begins.
   - Developers implement the system in small units based on the design specifications.
   - Each unit is typically developed and tested independently (unit testing).

4. ### **Integration and Testing** 🧪
   - Combine all units into a complete system.
   - Perform rigorous testing to identify and fix defects.
   - Ensure the system meets the specified requirements and functions as intended.

5. ### **Deployment** 🚀
   - Deploy the system to the production environment.
   - Make the software available to users and provide necessary training and documentation.

6. ### **Maintenance** 🔧
   - Address any issues reported by users.
   - Provide ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and minor enhancements as needed.

---

### ✅ Best Use Cases
- Projects with **fixed requirements** and scope.
- Environments where **compliance and documentation** are critical.
- When **clarity and predictability** outweigh the need for flexibility.

---

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Difficult to accommodate changes once the process is underway.
- Late discovery of defects may lead to higher costs.
- Not ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve.

## 💧 Waterfall Model: Advantages & Disadvantages
