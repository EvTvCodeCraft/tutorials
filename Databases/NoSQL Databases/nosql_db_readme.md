3. **Contribute:** If you'd like to contribute to this repository, refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Types of NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases are categorized into four main types based on data models:

1. **Document Stores:** Stores data in a document-like format, typically JSON or XML.
2. **Key-Value Stores:** Stores data as key-value pairs.
3. **Column-Family Stores:** Stores data in columns, similar to rows and columns in RDBMS.
4. **Graph Databases:** Stores data in a graph structure, ideal for relationship-based data.
