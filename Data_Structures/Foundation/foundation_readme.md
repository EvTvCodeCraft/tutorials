## Topics Covered

This repository covers a variety of foundational data structure concepts, including:

- **Introduction to Data Structures:**
  - Definition and importance of data structures.
  - Types of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.).

- **Arrays:**
  - Array creation and manipulation.
  - Multi-dimensional arrays.
  - Array operations (searching, sorting, etc.).

- **Linked Lists:**
  - Singly linked lists.
  - Doubly linked lists.
  - Circular linked lists.

- **Stacks and Queues:**
  - Stack data structure.
  - Queue data structure.
  - Applications and use cases.

- **Trees:**
  - Binary trees.
  - Binary search trees.
  - Tree traversal algorithms.

- **Graphs:**
  - Graph representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix).
  - Graph traversal (DFS, BFS).

- **Hashing:**
  - Hash functions.
  - Hash tables and collision handling.
