## Data Structures Roadmap

Understanding data structures is fundamental in computer science, enabling efficient organization and management of data. This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to various data structures and related topics.

- **Foundation:**
  - **Understanding Data Types:**
    - Learn about basic data types (integers, floats, booleans, characters) and their representations.

  - **Arrays:**
    - Understand one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, array operations, and their time and space complexity.

  - **Linked Lists:**
    - Learn about types of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular), linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal), and their advantages and disadvantages.

  - **Stacks:**
    - Understand the stack data structure, stack operations (push, pop), and its applications (e.g., expression evaluation, backtracking).

  - **Queues:**
    - Learn about the queue data structure, queue operations (enqueue, dequeue), and its applications (e.g., BFS traversal, scheduling).

- **Advanced Data Structures:**
  - **Trees:**
    - Understand binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees, along with tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

  - **Heaps:**
    - Learn about heaps, heap properties, heap operations (insertion, deletion), and their applications (e.g., heap sort, priority queues).

  - **Graphs:**
    - Understand graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), graph traversals (DFS, BFS), and graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, minimum spanning tree).

  - **Hashing:**
    - Learn about hash functions, hash tables, collision resolution strategies, and their applications.

  - **Trie:**
    - Understand the trie data structure, trie operations, and its applications (e.g., prefix searching).

  - **Disjoint Set (Union-Find):**
    - Learn about disjoint set data structure, union-find operations, and their applications (e.g., cycle detection, Kruskal's algorithm).

- **Advanced Concepts:**
  - **Complexity Analysis:**
    - Understand time and space complexity analysis for various operations on data structures.

  - **Design Patterns for Data Structures:**
    - Learn about common design patterns (e.g., singleton, factory) applied to data structures.

  - **Concurrency and Parallel Data Structures:**
    - Understand concurrent data structures and their applications in parallel programming.

  - **Persistent Data Structures:**
    - Learn about persistent data structures and their applications in functional programming.

- **Additional Data Structures:**
  - **Skip List:**
    - Learn about skip lists, their structure, and efficient searching in skip lists.

  - **Bloom Filter:**
    - Understand the Bloom filter data structure and its applications in set membership testing.

  - **Suffix Tree and Array:**
    - Learn about suffix trees and suffix arrays, their construction, and their applications (e.g., string searching).
