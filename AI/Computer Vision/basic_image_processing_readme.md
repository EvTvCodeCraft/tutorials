# Basics of Image Processing

Image processing involves manipulating and analyzing digital images to enhance their quality or extract valuable information. Below, we delve into key techniques and concepts in image processing, along with mathematical formulations where applicable.

## Image Enhancement

Image enhancement aims to improve the visual appearance of images by adjusting their properties such as brightness, contrast, and sharpness. Here are some common techniques:

### Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization redistributes pixel intensities to improve contrast. Given an input image \( I(x, y) \), the histogram equalization operation is defined as:

\[ I_{\text{equalized}}(x, y) = T[I(x, y)] \]

where \( T \) is the transformation function obtained by mapping the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the image histogram to a uniform distribution.

### Gamma Correction

Gamma correction adjusts the brightness levels of images. The gamma correction function is defined as:

\[ I_{\text{corrected}}(x, y) = I(x, y)^\gamma \]

where \( \gamma \) is the gamma parameter, typically ranging between 0.5 and 2.

### Spatial Filtering

Spatial filtering techniques modify pixel values to enhance or smooth image features. One common operation is convolution with a filter kernel \( H \):

\[ I_{\text{filtered}}(x, y) = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \sum_{j=-b}^{b} I(x+i, y+j) \cdot H(i, j) \]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the extents of the filter kernel.

### Noise Reduction

Noise reduction methods aim to remove unwanted artifacts or disturbances from images. For instance, Gaussian blur is given by:

\[ I_{\text{blurred}}(x, y) = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \sum_{j=-b}^{b} I(x+i, y+j) \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} \exp\left(-\frac{i^2 + j^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \]

where \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel.

## Image Segmentation

Image segmentation divides an image into multiple regions or segments to simplify its representation or facilitate further analysis. Techniques include:

### Thresholding

Thresholding separates regions based on pixel intensity thresholds. For a grayscale image, thresholding can be defined as:

\[ T(x, y) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } I(x, y) > T_{\text{th}} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

where \( T_{\text{th}} \) is the threshold value.

### Edge Detection

Edge detection algorithms highlight boundaries between regions of different intensities. The gradient magnitude \( G \) can be computed using techniques like the Sobel operator:

\[ G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} \]

where \( G_x \) and \( G_y \) are the gradients in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, respectively.

### Region-based Segmentation

Region-based segmentation algorithms group pixels into homogeneous regions based on color, texture, or intensity. One approach is clustering, where pixels are grouped into clusters using techniques like \( k \)-means clustering.
