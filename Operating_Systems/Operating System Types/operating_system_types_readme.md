## **Introduction** 🎯

Operating systems (OS) are a fundamental part of every computing system, and they come in different types, each designed for specific purposes. This repository is here to explore these OS types and the concepts that make them unique. The focus is on **specialized operating systems** such as:

- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- Distributed Operating Systems
- Embedded Operating Systems
- And many others!

This repository provides comprehensive tutorials, resources, and guides on these OS concepts.
