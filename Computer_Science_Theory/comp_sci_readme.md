## Introduction to Computer Science

- **Description:**
  Computer Science is the study of computers, algorithms, and the principles that underlie them. It encompasses both the theoretical and practical aspects of how computers function, store and process data, and solve problems.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Overview of computer science.
    - Definition and purpose.
    - Historical development.
  - Relevance and applications.
    - Impact on various industries.
    - Career opportunities in computer science.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Description:**
  Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for performing computations or solving problems. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Time and space complexity.
    - Understanding algorithm efficiency.
  - Array, linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph.
    - Basic data structures and their operations.
  - Sorting and searching algorithms.
    - Various algorithms and their implementations.
  - Dynamic programming.
    - Solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler, overlapping subproblems.

## Computational Theory

- **Description:**
  Computational theory explores what can and cannot be computed, the nature and limitations of algorithms, and the classification of problems based on their inherent difficulty.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Turing machines.
    - A theoretical device that manipulates symbols on an infinite strip of tape according to a table of rules.
  - Church-Turing thesis.
    - A hypothesis about the nature of computable functions.
  - Halting problem.
    - A decision problem about properties of computer programs.
  - Theory of computation.
    - Formal study of algorithms and their computational complexity.

## Automata Theory

- **Description:**
  Automata theory deals with abstract mathematical models that represent computing devices and their operations.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Finite automata.
    - Simplest forms of automata with a finite number of states.
  - Regular expressions.
    - Formalism for expressing strings of symbols.
  - Context-free grammars.
    - A more expressive way of defining languages.
  - Pushdown automata.
    - Automata with a stack for additional memory.

## Formal Languages

- **Description:**
  Formal languages are sets of strings with defined rules for their formation. They play a crucial role in the analysis of programming languages and compilers.

- **Topics Covered:**
  - Chomsky hierarchy.
    - A classification of formal languages based on their generative power.
  - Regular languages.
    - The simplest type of formal language, often described using regular expressions.
  - Context-free languages.
    - Languages defined by context-free grammars.
  - Backus-Naur Form (BNF).
    - A notation technique used for context-free grammars.
