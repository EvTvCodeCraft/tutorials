## Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Description:**
  Algorithms and Data Structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that focus on effective ways to organize and process data, enabling efficient problem-solving and software development.

- **Topics Covered:**

  - **Time and Space Complexity:**
    Understanding the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity is crucial for selecting the most suitable algorithm for a given problem. It involves analyzing how the running time and memory requirements grow as the input size increases.

  - **Array:**
    An array is a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Access to elements is based on their index, allowing for fast access but limited flexibility in size.

  - **Linked List:**
    A linked list is a data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows dynamic memory allocation and is efficient for insertion and deletion operations.

  - **Stack:**
    A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top. Commonly used for backtracking, expression evaluation, and parsing.

  - **Queue:**
    A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. It models real-world scenarios like waiting lines.

  - **Tree:**
    A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, typically organized in a branching structure. Common types include binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees, used in searching, sorting, and organizing hierarchical data.

  - **Graph:**
    A graph is a versatile data structure composed of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs are widely used to represent networks, social relationships, maps, and various other applications.

  - **Sorting and Searching Algorithms:**
    Sorting algorithms arrange data in a particular order, while searching algorithms find a specific element in a data set. Common sorting algorithms include quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort, while searching algorithms include binary search and linear search.

  - **Dynamic Programming:**
    Dynamic programming is a technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. It stores the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions.
