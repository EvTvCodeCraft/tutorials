## Formal Languages

- **Description:**
  Formal Languages are sets of strings defined by specific rules, often used to describe the syntax of programming languages and various other applications. Understanding formal languages is vital for compiler design, parsing, and language theory.

- **Topics Covered:**

  - **Chomsky Hierarchy:**
    The Chomsky hierarchy classifies formal languages into four types based on their generative power. It includes:
    - Type 0: Recursively Enumerable Languages (Turing machines).
    - Type 1: Context-Sensitive Languages (Linear-bounded automata).
    - Type 2: Context-Free Languages (Pushdown automata).
    - Type 3: Regular Languages (Finite automata).

  - **Regular Languages:**
    Regular languages are the simplest formal languages and can be defined using regular expressions or finite automata. They have various applications in lexical analysis and pattern matching.

  - **Context-Free Languages (CFLs):**
    Context-free languages are defined by context-free grammars and can be recognized by pushdown automata. They are fundamental in syntax analysis and parsing in compilers.

  - **Backus-Naur Form (BNF):**
    BNF is a notation technique commonly used to describe the syntax of programming languages and other formal languages. It provides a precise way to define the grammar of a language.

  - **Pumping Lemma:**
    The pumping lemma is a critical tool to prove that certain languages are not regular. It helps in understanding the limitations of regular languages.

  - **Decidability and Undecidability:**
    Decidability refers to the ability to determine if a given input belongs to a language. Some problems related to formal languages are proven to be undecidable.
