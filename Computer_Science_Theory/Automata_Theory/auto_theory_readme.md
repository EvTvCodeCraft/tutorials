## Automata Theory

- **Description:**
  Automata Theory is a branch of theoretical computer science that deals with abstract mathematical models of computation. It plays a fundamental role in understanding the limitations and capabilities of computing devices.

- **Topics Covered:**

  - **Finite Automata:**
    Finite automata are the simplest type of automata with a finite number of states. They recognize regular languages and are widely used in lexical analysis.

  - **Regular Expressions:**
    Regular expressions are formal expressions used to represent regular languages. They are fundamental in pattern matching and searching.

  - **Context-Free Grammars:**
    Context-free grammars define context-free languages. They are more expressive than regular languages and are used in syntax analysis and parsing.

  - **Pushdown Automata:**
    Pushdown automata are extensions of finite automata with a stack. They can recognize context-free languages and are used in parsing.

  - **Turing Machines:**
    Turing machines are abstract mathematical models of computation. They are capable of simulating any algorithm and are central to the study of computability and complexity.

  - **Non-deterministic Automata:**
    Non-deterministic automata allow multiple possible transitions from a state for a given input symbol. They play a crucial role in understanding computational complexity.
