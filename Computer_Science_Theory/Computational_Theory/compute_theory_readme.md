## Computational Theory

- **Description:**
  Computational Theory deals with the study of algorithms, computability, and computational complexity. It seeks to understand the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computation.

- **Topics Covered:**

  - **Turing Machines:**
    A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine capable of simulating any algorithm. It comprises a tape, a tape head, and a set of states.

  - **Church-Turing Thesis:**
    The Church-Turing thesis asserts that any effectively calculable function can be computed by a Turing machine. It is a hypothesis about the nature of computable functions.

  - **Halting Problem:**
    The halting problem is a classic example of a decision problem that is proven to be undecidable for Turing machines. It involves determining whether a given Turing machine halts on a specific input.

  - **Decidability and Undecidability:**
    A problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can determine the correct answer for all instances of the problem. Conversely, a problem is undecidable if there is no such algorithm.

  - **Complexity Theory:**
    Complexity theory analyzes the resources (time, space) required by algorithms to solve problems. It classifies problems into different complexity classes based on their computational complexity.

  - **P vs. NP Problem:**
    The P vs. NP problem is one of the most significant unsolved problems in computer science. It questions whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (in "polynomial time") can also be solved quickly (in "polynomial time").
